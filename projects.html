        <h2>01<br>Challenging the Norms of Learning</h2>
        <p>At the heart of our mission is a simple belief: education should never be a privilege; it should be a pathway open to everyone. Whether it’s mentoring students, designing accessible learning spaces, or championing growth mindsets, we’re working to tear down the silent walls that keep knowledge gated. We focus on community-based learning, evidence-driven teaching, and making knowledge stick — not just for today, but for a lifetime.</p>

        <h2>02<br>Redefining What It Means to Be Well</h2>
        <p>At SFF, we see student wellness as the foundation for everything else. Health isn’t just about doctor visits or gym class — it’s about emotional safety, mental clarity, and a sense of being cared for. Whether it’s partnering with schools to support access to hygiene, mental health days, or better food, we’re exploring how to build environments where students feel nourished, inside and out.</p>

        <h2>03<br>Rethinking How Progress Is Made</h2>
        <p>We’re early in this pillar, but the vision is clear. Our R&D isn’t about labs or test tubes. It’s about listening, prototyping, and learning in real time with the communities we serve. From experimenting with tutoring formats to gathering feedback on what works in classrooms, we’re committed to building a culture of evidence-based action. Every idea is a draft, and every draft is a step toward impact.</p>
